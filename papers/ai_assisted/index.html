  <h2>AI Assisted Results</h2>

<p>This page collects a series of papers and essays that were created
with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Each work presented
here is not a simple transcript of AI output, but the product of an
iterative and thoughtful collaboration between human author and AI
model.</p>

<p>The subject matter may span diverse areas, from technical research
and conceptual essays to creative explorations. In each case, AI
served as a partner: generating ideas, suggesting structures,
surfacing connections, and accelerating the drafting process. At the
same time, human judgment, interpretation, and refinement shaped the
final results into coherent and meaningful contributions.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this collection is twofold. First, to document
how AI can act as a powerful tool for intellectual and creative work
when guided by human expertise. Second, to make transparent the
collaborative process itself, showing not just outcomes but also how
interaction with AI can enrich writing and problem-solving.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide readers with access to works that demonstrate
this partnership in practice. By linking to completed essays and
research pieces, we hope to inspire others to experiment with
AI-assisted writing, while also inviting critical reflection on its
role, limits, and potential.</p>

<h3>Satire</h3>

I include these satirical essay because it was partially produced with
the help of AI, illustrating that the line between artificial
intelligence and artificial stupidity can be surprisingly thin.
