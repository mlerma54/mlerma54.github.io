<h1>Math E11 Spring 1999</h1>

After attending this course I decided to write a brief summary about
the main core theories in Physics:

<blockquote>
<a href="physics.pdf">Physics: A Brief Summary</a>
(last updated Jul. 10, 2013)
</blockquote>

It contains (or will contain) schematic information about Mechanics,
Electromagnetism, Special Relativity, General relativity, Quantum
Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory, and posibly other subjects.

<p>

Its current contents are:

<ol>

<li> Introduction

<li> Mechanics

<li> Statistical Physics

<li> Electromagnetism

<li> Special Relativity

<li> General Relativity

<li> Quantum Mechanics

<li> Quantum Field Theory (under construction)

</ol>
