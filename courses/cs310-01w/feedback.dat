The web notes are very useful.  Could you however, provide answers to the questions given in the notes?

Could we please get solutions to the homework problems?

The TA is really no help at all.  He doesn't seem to care at all and is only bothered by that fact that we're there.  I'm not sure that you can really do anything about that - just letting you know.

I remember seeing a thing asking about how you could change the course for next quarter to make it run smoother.  In general the solution I would offer is this.

1)  Get rid of the text book -- it is hard to follow and understand and uses a different approach then your lecture notes.  Plus it is ridiculously expensive for the use that I have gotten out of it.

2)  Your lecture notes are really helpful.  But to make them even more helpful, put in more actual examples.  When you put in the sample problems with numbers and variables (and not just variables -- numbers make it easier to follow the problem) then we would have a good idea of what is going on.

3)  Make sure that the TA is comfortable with the material.  In general he has done a good job this quarter, but there have been a few times when he didn't know how to solve the problems in the homework.

In general I feel those three things would make a big difference in how much people could comprehend and help themselves with the material.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Thanks,
