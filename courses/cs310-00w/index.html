<h2>A Quote</h2>

<blockquote>
[...] 
The story suggest that assertions, or simply Boolean expressions,
are really needed in programming. But it is not enough to know how 
to write Boolean expressions; one needs to know how to <em>reason</em>
with them, how to simplify them, to prove that one follows from 
another, and to prove that one is not true in some state, and so forth. 
And, later on, we will see that it is necessary a kind of assertion 
that it is not part of the usual Boolean expression language of 
Pascal, PL/1 or FORTRAN, the "quantified" assertion.
[...] 
More importantly, the study of program correctness proofs has led 
to the discovery and elucidation of methods for <em>developing</em>
programs. Basically one attempts to develop a program and its proofs
hand-in-hand, with the proof ideas leading the way! If the methods
are practiced with care, they can lead to programs that are free
of errors, that take less time to develop and debug, and that are 
much more easily understood (by those who have studied the subject).

<p><li><a href="grades.html">List of Final Grades</a>

<p><li>Reminder: <strong>Final Exam</strong>, Tuesday, March
14, 2000, 9:00-11:00am in Searle Room 2370. Whole syllabus.
<p>
The exam will consists of solving a list of problems (similar to but
easier than the ones in the homework). 
You may use your class notes and a copy of the notes that I have 
been posting up to now (make sure that you have the latest version 
of the notes, or that you have corrected all the typos found up to now). 
You are not allowed to use books or any other material. You may use 
a pocket calculator to help you with computations, but you do not need 
to fully carry out complicated computations.

<p><li>(3/3/2000) Through the feedback feature I have received a
couple of messages expressing some disagreement about the grader's
(not the TA's!) reasons for being a little behind in returning the
last homework assignments. I have a few things to say about this:

<ul>

<li>First of all, please, remember that <strong>the grader and the TA
are two different people</strong>.

<li>Working while being sick is a physical impossibility.  We need to
be realistic about this.

<li>The grader has gone far beyond duty in most of his work.  He
solved each homework set by himself, providing a double check for my
own answers.  He had no obligation to post detailed solutions to the
homework.  

<li><strong>The grader is making a great effort to catch up</strong>. 
The homework assignments will be graded and returned soon.

</ul>

<p><li>Reminder: <strong>First Midterm</strong>, Wednesday, February
9, 2000, 10:00-10:50am in Searle Room 2370. Logic, Sets, Relations,
Functions, Operations and Counting (sections 1-5 in the notes).
<p>
The exam will consists of solving a list of problems (similar to but 
easier than the ones in the homework).
You may use your class notes and a copy of the notes that I have 
been posting up to now (make sure that you have the latest version 
of the notes, or that you have corrected all the typos found up to now). 
You are not allowed to use books or any other material. You may use 
a pocket calculator to help you with computations, but you do not need 
to fully carry out complicated computations  - e.g., it is OK to leave 
24!/(15!9!) instead of 1307504 as a final answer.

<p><li>I has been recently asked the question "how is this material
[the material covered in this course and, in particular, Logic]
relevant to computer science?" There is an excellent answer in David
Gries: <em>The Science of Programming</em>, Springer-Verlag, Part 0:
"Why Use Logic? Why Prove Programs Correct?" (The book is in the
Science Engineering Library, call number 001.642 G848s.) Highly
recommendable.

<p><li>2/1/00: I apologize because some of you asked for appointments
for discussing the homework and I have been asking all of you to come
on Thursday at noon. I have been very busy with computer
administration tasks and I have had little time for taking care of
other business. However on Thursday I will answer your questions about
the homework. If you have non homework related questions, I might be
able to give you an appointment at some other time.

<p><li>1/28/00: There has been a few changes in the office
hours. Check the <a href="#teach">teachers</a> section.
<p>
I would like to address the following suggestion that I have received
through the "feedback" feature: "Provide more examples that can be
related to the homework." That is precisely the purpose of the problem
session conducted by the TA. I have been told that a considerable
amount of time and effort is dedicated to discuss the homework
assignments during the problem session. However the purpose of the
problem session is not to provide help with the homework, but to
complement the lectures with practical applications and problem
solving activities. If you have specific questions about the homework
you may ask for help during office hours, including my office hour on
Thursdays at noon, and I will be glad to provide you hints and help.
<p>
The homework should be turned in at the beginning of the class of the
day indicated on the assignment. The grader is so kind as to allow
some extra time for you to turn in the homework, but please, do not
use that extra time for getting additional help. It would not be fair
to the students that turned in the homework in time.

<!--
<p><li>I have been asked to post the notes before, instead of after
class, so that you can have a chance of getting familiar with the
material before the lecture. I am going to do it so from now on,
although I may find convenient to make some minor modifications in
some points of the notes after the interaction with the students in
class. 
-->

<p><li>I am planning to adjust the syllabus once in a while.
Check this web page often.

<!--
<p><li>Important notice: I have been informed that the enrollment list
      may be adjusted in order to give priority to seniority and
      graduation requirements. Please, note that I will not be making
      decisions on this regard. All the bureaucracy associated with
      the process will be handled by the CS Department.

<p>

The "sections" listed on the 4th column are from 
Grimaldi's book.
