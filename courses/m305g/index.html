<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>

Homework will be assigned daily and collected each Friday prior 
to the start of class. Questions regarding problems with the homework 
are best discussed in office hours or with others in the class. 

<p>

<a name="exams">

<h3>Exams</h3>

<p>

There will be two tests during the semester and one final exam. 

<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Test 1:</strong> Friday, February 14, 1997, chapters 2 and 3.
<li><strong>Test 2:</strong> Friday, March 28, 1997, chapters 4 and 5.
(Rescheduled for Friday, April 4, 1997 due to the half-holiday on 3/28/1997.)
<li><strong>Final:</strong> Saturday, May 10, 1997, 2:00-5:00 pm., in 
RLM 7.104.
Part of the final will be 
over Chapters 6, 7 and 8, the rest will be comprehensive over the material 
from the other exams.

</ul>

Calculators are not allowed in the exams. 
No make-up exams will be given. In the event of an extreme and well 
documented absence (such as hospitalization) the final may be weighted 
to count for the missing exam. The decision to do so is at the sole
discretion of the instructor. In the case of a missed exam, contact 
the instructor as soon as possible. 

<p>

<a name="grad">

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>

The course will be graded as follows: 

<p>

<ul>

<li>Homework: 30%
<li>Tests: 30% (15% each)
<li>Final: 40%

</ul>

<p>

Only a part of the homework will be graded, depending on the 
Grader's availability. 
The three lowest homework scores will be dropped in calculating the 
homework grade. 
<p>
The relation between average grades and letter-grades is as follows:

<p>

<ul>

<li>A: 90-100% 
<li>B: 80-89% 
<li>C: 70-79% 
<li>D: 60-69% 
<li>F: 0-59%

</ul>

<h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

<p>

<a name="hwkassop">

<h4>Optional Assigments</h4>

<ul>

<p><li>First Optional Assignment, due on Friday, May 2:<br>

    <ol>

    <p><li> Choose one of the following sections:

       <ul>

       <p><li> 3.7: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
       <p><li> 4.6: Partial Fractions.
       <p><li> 7.6: De Moivre's Theorem.

       </ul>

    <p><li> Study it.

    <p><li> Do the standart assignment for the chosen section.

    </ol>

   <p>Note that this assignment is <em>optional</em>. As you know, 
      the three lowest homework scores will be dropped in calculating 
      the homework grade. If you choose to do the optional assignment, 
      I will drop a fourth lowest homework score.

<p><li>Second Optional Assignment, due on Friday, May 2:<br>

    <ul>

    <p><li>Solve the Thirty-Seven-Year-Old Puzzle, p.353.
           Since the back of the book already contains 
           a possible solution to this problem, 
           in order to get credit your solution 
           must be <em>different</em> from 
           the one provided there. 

    </ul>
    
    <p>Same as above: if you solve this assigment, I will drop 
       an additional lowest homework score.

</ul>

Note that I graded the final exam considering 5 questions

Place and time: RLM 7.104, 2:00-4:45 pm. It will be a

<p><li>Monday, April 28, 1997: <strong>Practice Exam</strong>
and <strong>Instructor Evaluation Survey</strong>. This day 
I will give copies of a practice final exam for you to study 
and try on your own. Next Wednesday 30, and Friday 2, you may 
bring comments and suggestions so that the actual final 
exam can be designed to be as fair as possible. Also this day 
you will do the instructor evaluation survey. If you have anything 
to say about the instructor, do not miss this class.

<p><li>Friday, April 4, 1997: <strong>Test 2</strong> 
(initialy scheduled for Friday, March 31, 1997). 
Place and time: the usual ones for this class. 
This test covers chapters 4 and 5.

test for March 28. It will be over the chapters 4 and 5.

Place and time: the usual ones for this class. 
Note that technically this test covers the whole chapters
2 (sec.2.1-2.5) and 3 (sec. 3.1-3.6), but since the last class 
has been so close to the date of the test, no question from 
section 3.6 will be included in it. However, the matter from 
that section is very important and could be included in the 
final exam. Also the homework due on Friday 14 includes some 
problems from section 3.6.<br>

test for February 14. It will be over the chapter 2 and sections 
3.1-3.4 of chapter 3. Note that the test on February 14 will be 
over the <em>whole</em> chapters 2 and 3 (we cannot include the whole
