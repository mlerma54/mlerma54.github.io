<h2>A Quote</h2>

<blockquote>
[...] 
The story suggest that assertions, or simply Boolean expressions,
are really needed in programming. But it is not enough to know how 
to write Boolean expressions; one needs to know how to <em>reason</em>
with them, how to simplify them, to prove that one follows from 
another, and to prove that one is not true in some state, and so forth. 
And, later on, we will see that it is necessary a kind of assertion 
that it is not part of the usual Boolean expression language of 
Pascal, PL/1 or FORTRAN, the "quantified" assertion.
[...] 
More importantly, the study of program correctness proofs has led 
to the discovery and elucidation of methods for <em>developing</em>
programs. Basically one attempts to develop a program and its proofs
hand-in-hand, with the proof ideas leading the way! If the methods
are practiced with care, they can lead to programs that are free
of errors, that take less time to develop and debug, and that are 
much more easily understood (by those who have studied the subject).

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<ul>

<p><li>Reminder: <b>Final Exam</b>, Wednesday, March 14, 2001,
9:00-11:00am in Tech L150.  It will cover the <b>whole</b> syllabus.
You may use the posted "Notes on Discrete Mathematics" and your
personal class notes during the exam.

<!--

<p><li>Reminder: <b>Midterm Exam</b>, Friday, February 9, 2000,
10:00-10:50am in Tech L150. Logic, Sets, Relations, Functions,
Operations and Counting (sections 1-5 in the notes).
You may use the posted "Notes on Discrete Mathematics" 
and your personal class notes during the exam.

<p><li><a href="special_assignment.html">Special Assignment</a>
(voluntary).

-->

<p><li><b>About homework:</b>

<ul>

<p><li>As you know, homework is assigned weekly and will be collected
and graded by the TA. After being graded I will return it to you in
class.  If you cannot pick it up in class, you can do it at a later
date in the TA office.

<p><li><b>Note</b> that the volume of homework to be graded may
<em>exceed</em> the teaching duties of the TA. In that case <em>only
part of the problems or questions assigned will be graded.</em>

<li><strong>Textbooks</strong>

<p>

Ralph P. Grimaldi: <em>Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics,</em>
4th edition, Addison-Wesley.

<p>

Miguel A. Lerma: 
<em>Notes on Discrete Mathematics</em>. (See bellow.)

<a name="prob">

<li><strong>Problem Sessions</strong>

<p>

The problem sessions will be held on Tuesdays under the TA's
supervision.

<p>

<a name="hwk">

<li><strong>Homework</strong>

<p>

The homework assignments will be posted on this web page. 

<p>


<a name="exams">

<li><strong>Exams</strong>

<p>

There will be one one-hour Midterm Exam and one two-hour Final Exam.

<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Midterm:</strong> 
Friday, February 9, 2001, 10:00-10:50am in
Tech L150.


<li><strong>Final:</strong> 
Wednesday, March 14, 2001, 9:00-11:00am in
Tech L150. 


</ul>

<p>

No make-up exams will be given. In the event of an extreme and well
documented absence (such as hospitalization) the final may be weighted
to count for the missing exam. In the case of a missed exam, contact
the instructor as soon as possible.

<p>

<a name="grad">

<li><strong>Grading</strong>

<p>

The course will be graded as follows: 

<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Homework Assignments</strong>: 30%
<li><strong>Midterm</strong>: 30% 
<li><strong>Final</strong>: 40%

</ul>

<p>

The lowest homework score will be dropped in calculating the homework
grade.

If you want to change sections, or add/drop the course, please do so
at the CS Department Office.

<h2>Lectures and Homework Assignments</h2>

Note: I am going to be releasing notes ("Notes on Discrete
Mathematics", in PDF format) that you can download by clicking in the
links of the "subject" column of the syllabus bellow. The table of
contents, the introduction and the appendix are here:

<ul>
<li><a href="notes/dm-contents.pdf">Table of Contents</a> 
- (warning: the table of contents will not be accurate 
until the end of the quarter)
<li><a href="notes/dm-intro.pdf">Introduction</a>
<li><a href="notes/dm-appen-1.pdf">Appendix</a>
</ul>

<p>

Depending on various circumstances, the schedule shown bellow may
experiment small modifications.

<p>

The "sections" listed on the 4th column are from 
Grimaldi's book.

<p>

The "Suggested Exercises" column contains some exercises from the book
that you may find useful to try. They are not homework nor need to be
turned in.

<p>

<!-- #include -->


<p>

The complete set of notes is
<a href="notes/dm-all.pdf">here</a>. However I do not recommend
to download the whole set until the end of the quarter, since 
I may still make some changes to the notes.
