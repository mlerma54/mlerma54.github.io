  <h2>AI Assisted Results</h2>
  <font color="red">CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION</font>
</center>

<p>This page collects a series of papers and essays that were created
with the assistance of artificial intelligence. Each work presented
here is not a simple transcript of AI output, but the product of an
iterative and thoughtful collaboration between human author and AI
model.</p>

<p>The subject matter may span diverse areas, from technical research
and conceptual essays to creative explorations. In each case, AI
served as a partner: generating ideas, suggesting structures,
surfacing connections, and accelerating the drafting process. At the
same time, human judgment, interpretation, and refinement shaped the
final results into coherent and meaningful contributions.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this collection is twofold. First, to document
how AI can act as a powerful tool for intellectual and creative work
when guided by human expertise. Second, to make transparent the
collaborative process itself, showing not just outcomes but also how
interaction with AI can enrich writing and problem-solving.</p>

<p>The goal is to provide readers with access to works that demonstrate
this partnership in practice. By linking to completed essays and
research pieces, we hope to inspire others to experiment with
AI-assisted writing, while also inviting critical reflection on its
role, limits, and potential.</p>

<h3>Satire</h3>

I include these satirical essay because it was partially produced with
the help of AI, illustrating that the line between artificial
intelligence and artificial stupidity can be surprisingly thin.

<h3>Stories and Essays</h3>

<ol>

  <li><a href="Dilemma_in_the_Quantum_Laboratory-Trilingual.pdf" target="_blank">Dilemma in the Quantum Laboratory - A Variant of Newcomb's Paradox</a> - A three part story about the Newcomb's Paradox interpreted as a quantum phenomenon. The original is in Spanish, all the English content is AI generated.</li>

  <li><a href="tidal-forces-and-apparent-size.pdf" target="_blank">Tidal Forces and Apparent Size</a> - An study on the relation between the apparent size of a moon an the tidal force exerted on its planet, with an illustration using the Earth--Moon system. The text has been produced by the AI system through a dialogue with a human (me).</li>

  <li><a href="moon-and-the-sun.pdf" target="_blank">A Dialogue on Tidal Forces in the Manner of Galileo</a> - Essay about the relation between apparent size and tidal force, this time written in the style of a Galilean dialogue. Disclaimer: although the essay has been written in Galilean style the essay uses facts and were discovered and elaborated after Galileo's times - not something Galileo himself could have written given only the knowledge of his epoch. </li>

  <li><a href="four-kinds-of-artificial-things.pdf" target="_blank">Four Kinds of Artificial Things: A Simple Guide to Reproducibility, Uniqueness, and What We Make</a> - The four kingdoms of the artificial world. Included for reference: <a href="Object_classification_analysis-Original-Discussion.pdf" target="_blank">original dialog with the AI agent</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="Happiness_and_memory_debate.pdf" target="_blank">Happiness and memory debate</a> - An exchange with the AI on the value of present experiences versus the value of memories of those experiences. There is no report this time, this is the full conversation presented without changes. I noticed that the AI changed its mind at one point during the debate, conceding that my arguments were strong enough to justify the shift in perspective.</li>

  <li><a href="automatation-post-scarcity-and-human-dignity.pdf" target="_blank">Automation, Post-Scarcity, and Human Dignity</a> - A reflection on the preservation of human dignity in a post-scarcity society. This report, fully generated by AI, summarizes an actual discussion between the author and an AI assistant.</li>
  
  <li><a href="laws-of-robotics-essay.pdf" target="_blank">The Laws of Robotics, Moral Formalization, and the Limits of Rational Control</a> - An essay based on the Three Laws of Robotics introduced by Isaac Asimov, examining their applicability as actual moral rules. The AI agent’s position that morality is an emergent phenomenon in human societies is particularly compelling. However, the final remark concerning post-scarcity societies would benefit from further elaboration; for that, I recommend <em><a href="automatation-post-scarcity-and-human-dignity.pdf" target="_blank">Automation, Post-Scarcity, and Human Dignity</a></em>.</li>

  <li><a href="Traffic_Flow_as_a_Fluid-Dynamical_System.pdf" target="_blank">Traffic Flow as a Fluid-Dynamical System: Theory, Jams, and Control</a> - A technical overview of traffic flow modeling within the framework of continuum fluid mechanics. It provides a modeling theory and practical applications such as how to prevent traffic jams. Fully generated by the AI agent after an actual discussion between the author and the AI assistant. Included for reference: <a href="Traffic_as_Fluid_Dynamics-original-chat.pdf" target="_blank">original dialog with the AI agent</a>.</li>
