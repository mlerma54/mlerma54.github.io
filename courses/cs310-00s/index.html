<h2>A Quote</h2>

<blockquote>
[...] 
The story suggest that assertions, or simply Boolean expressions,
are really needed in programming. But it is not enough to know how 
to write Boolean expressions; one needs to know how to <em>reason</em>
with them, how to simplify them, to prove that one follows from 
another, and to prove that one is not true in some state, and so forth. 
And, later on, we will see that it is necessary a kind of assertion 
that it is not part of the usual Boolean expression language of 
Pascal, PL/1 or FORTRAN, the "quantified" assertion.
[...] 
More importantly, the study of program correctness proofs has led 
to the discovery and elucidation of methods for <em>developing</em>
programs. Basically one attempts to develop a program and its proofs
hand-in-hand, with the proof ideas leading the way! If the methods
are practiced with care, they can lead to programs that are free
of errors, that take less time to develop and debug, and that are 
much more easily understood (by those who have studied the subject).

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<ul>

<p>

<li>Reminder: <strong>Final Exam</strong>, Thursday, June 8,
2000, 9:00-11:00am in Tech M345. Whole syllabus.
<!--
<strong>Reminder: <strong>Midterm Exam</strong>, Wednesday, May 3,
2000, 10:00-10:50am in Tech M345. Logic, Sets, Relations,
Functions, Operations and Counting (sections 1-5 in the notes).
-->
<p>
The exam will consists of solving a list of problems (similar to but 
easier than the ones in the homework).
You may use your class notes and a copy of the notes that I have 
been posting up to now (make sure that you have the latest version 
of the notes, or that you have corrected all the typos found up to now). 
You are not allowed to use books or any other material. You may use 
a pocket calculator to help you with computations, but you do not need 
to fully carry out complicated computations  - e.g., it is OK to leave 
24!/(15!9!) instead of 1307504 as a final answer.


<!--
<p><li> The homework assignment No. 2 contained a typo in 
problem 3, part (b). It said "A symmetric difference B
contained in S is logically equivalent to A intersection S 
= B intersection S." It should say "A symmetric difference B
contained in S is logically equivalent to A - S = B - S." 
The typo has been corrected in the version currently posted.
-->

<!--
<p><li> Exceptionally next week there well be <b>two problem sessions</b>
with the TA, one on <b>Tuesday April 4th</b>, and another one on
<b>Thursday April 6th</b>. I heard from some students that cannot
attend the problem session on Thursdays, so it could be moved to
Tuesdays if there is agreement about it.

<li><strong>Textbooks</strong>

<p>

Ralph P. Grimaldi: <em>Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics,</em>
4th edition, Addison-Wesley.

<p>

Miguel A. Lerma: 
<em>Notes on Discrete Mathematics</em>. (See bellow.)

<p>

<a name="prob">

<li><strong>Problem Sessions</strong>

<p>

The problem sessions will be held on Thursdays under the TA's
supervision.

<p>

<a name="hwk">

<li><strong>Homework</strong>

<p>

The homework assignments will be posted on this web page. 

<p>


<a name="exams">

<li><strong>Exams</strong>

<p>

There will be one one-hour Midterm Exam and one two-hour Final Exam.

<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Midterm:</strong> 
Wednesday, May 3, 2000, 10:00-11:00am.


<li><strong>Final:</strong> 
Thursday, June 8, 2000, 9:00-11:00am.

</ul>

<p>

No make-up exams will be given. In the event of an extreme and well
documented absence (such as hospitalization) the final may be weighted
to count for the missing exam. In the case of a missed exam, contact
the instructor as soon as possible.

<p>

<a name="grad">

<li><strong>Grading</strong>

<p>

The course will be graded as follows: 

<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Homework Assignments</strong>: 30%
<li><strong>Midterm</strong>: 30% 
<li><strong>Final</strong>: 40%

</ul>

<p>

The lowest homework score will be dropped in calculating the homework
grade.

<li><strong>Add/Drop Policy</strong>

<p>

If you want to change sections, or add/drop the course, please do so
at the CS Department Office.

<h2>Lectures and Homework Assignments</h2>

Note: I am going to be releasing notes ("Notes on Discrete
Mathematics", in PDF format) that you can download by clicking in the
links of the "subject" column of the syllabus bellow. The table of
contents and the introduction are here:

<ul>
<li><a href="notes/dm-contents.pdf">Table of Contents</a> 
- (warning: the table of contents will not be accurate 
until the end of the quarter)
<li><a href="notes/dm-intro.pdf">Introduction</a>
</ul>

<p>

Depending on various circumstances, the schedule shown bellow may
experiment small modifications.

<p>

The "sections" listed on the 4th column are from 
Grimaldi's book.

<p>

The "Suggested Exercises" column contains some exercises from the book
that you may find useful to try. They are not homework nor need to be
turned in.

<p>

<!-- #include -->


<p>

The complete set of notes is
<a href="notes/dm-all.pdf">here</a>. However I do not recommend
to download the whole set until the end of the quarter, since 
I may still make some changes to the notes.
