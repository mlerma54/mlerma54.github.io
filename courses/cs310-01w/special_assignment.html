<h1>Special Assignment</h1>

The purpose of this assignment is to collect ideas intended to improve
various aspects of CS 310.

<p>

Assume that you are a professor in a new university that has just been
created. You are assigned the task of designing and organizing a new
course with title "<b>Mathematical Foundations of Computer
Science</b>."  The course will be required for Computer Science majors
and for some other courses in Engineering and other careers. Its
content should roughly consists of selected subjects in <em>Discrete
Mathematics</b> plus some applications to <em>Computer Science</em>.
You need to decide (justifying your decision if possible) things like:

<ul>
<p><li> <b>Syllabus for the course.</b> You may use the index of any
book on Discrete Mathematics as a guide for the material to be
covered.

<p><li> <b>Time</b> that should be spent on it, say 1 quarter, 2
quarters, a whole year... Assume that there are 3 lectures per week
plus perhaps 1 or 2 problem/quiz sessions.

<p><li> <b>Logistics:</b> number of midterms, problem sessions,
quizzes, grading policy...

<p><li> <b>Textbook</b> and other teaching materials.

<p><li> <b>Teaching resources</b>, say, 1 instructor, 1 TA, 1 grader
for homework (per section)?

<p><li> <b>Whatever</b> other aspects of the course you may consider
relevant, such a the size of the class, etc.

</ul>

Send me your thoughts by 
<a href="mailto:mlerma at math dot northwestern dot edu">email</a> or using the
"other comments" field in the <a href="feedback.html">feedback
feature</a>.  You do not need to think all the items, any idea abut
any of them may also be useful.  Also any ideas about how to improve
the current CS 310 would also be appreciated.
