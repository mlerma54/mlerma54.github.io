Could you do more examples in class? Many of the topics we cover seem very abstract, and i think it would help if we saw more application examples

--- right:
the lecture notes are great.  the book is not.  

--- wrong:
most students are c.s. majors and the only things that really excite them relates to computers.  even in trivial ways, relate everything back to computers.  some homework problems were good that way, e.g. RSA encryption problem, but most others are bland.

some hw sets were too hard, or the lack of solutions afterwards made them less rewarding an experience.

--- improve:
post solutions to past homeworks.  they can be as good a learning resource as anything else.

--- ta:
nice guy, but thursdays were inconvenient. tuesdays would have been better.

--- comments:
the homework sets were very hard, but this will have been a rewarding class if you do truly make the exams easier than the homeworks and your final curve respects the efforts of the students throughout the course and in completing the assignments.

the lack of class attendance should not be an insult, instead they're a testament to how good the notes are that you post to the web.  if your lectures could compliment the notes rather than be almost a reptition, and you spoke more directly to the class and seemed more involved, students would be much more eager to attend.

thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback, and i wish you luck next year.
