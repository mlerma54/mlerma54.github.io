<h1>How to Make an Appointment</h1>

If you need to see me in my office (Lunt 203), please, send me an <a
href="mailto:mlerma at math dot northwestern dot edu">email</a> stating when you
are planning to come and I will answer to confirm if I will be able to
receive you at that time. I am usually in my office M-F,
8:30am-5:30pm, except MWF while teaching, plus some random times at
which I may be required to fix some computer problem in the building.
