%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DISCLAIMER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% In spite of the effort to accommodate this template and the nuthesis
% class to the official requirements of the university to write a 
% Ph.D. dissertation, it is not possible to guarantee that it will 
% always work, and the author of the dissertation remains responsible
% for checking that such requirements are actually fulfilled by 
% his/her final work.

% If there is an introduction it must be the first chapter

\chapter{Introduction or Title of First Chapter}	% The first chapter.
				% \chapter command is of the form
				% \chapter[..]{..} or \chapter{..} where
	... text ...		% {chapter heading} and [entry in table of
				% contents].
\section{First section of chapter 1}
				% IMPORTANT: If your chapter heading consists
				% of more than one lines, it will be auto-
	... text ...		% matically broken into separate lines.
				% However, if you don't like the way LaTeX
				% breaks the chapter heading into lines, use
\section{Another section}	% `\newheadline' command to break lines.
				% Never use \\ in sectional (e.g., chapter,
	... text ...		% section, subsection) headings.

\chapter{Title of Second Chapter}	% Chapter 2.

	... text ...

\section{First section of chapter 2}

	... text...

\subsection{A subsection}

	... more text ...

\subsubsection{A subsubsection}

	... more text ...


% Alternatively, you may write the chapters in separate
% files, say chap1.tex, chap2.tex, etc., and include them 
% with commands:

%\include{chap1}

%\include{chap2}

% The command \includeonly above allows to include a selected 
% set of chapters only.

% Uncomment the 'singlespace' environment and '\bibsep' command
% if needed - some bibliographic styles overide the definition
% of 'thebibliography' in nuthesis.cls
%
\begin{singlespace}
%\bibsep 12pt
\clearpage\phantomsection % needed for hyperlikns to work correctly
\begin{thebibliography}{xxx}

\bibitem{label1} A bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.  A
bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.
\bibitem{label2} Another bibliographic item.  
\bibitem{label3} Yet another bibliographic item.  
% The usages of \bibitem and \cite{..} are 
% explained in Section 4.3 (page 73) of % LaTeX manual.
% Or you may use BibTeX.
\end{thebibliography}
\end{singlespace}

% (The following suggested by Francisco Iacobelli - 5/11/2010)
% In case, you want to use BibTeX, you should replace (or comment)
% the bibliography environment.
% Instead uncomment the following lines and replace <bib file>
% with your .bib file:
% \begin{singlespace}
% \bibsep 12pt
% \bibliographystyle{acm} %or another suitable style.
% \bibliography{<bib file>}
% \end{singlespace}
